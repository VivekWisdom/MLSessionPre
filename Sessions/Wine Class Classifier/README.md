# Wine Quality Dataset

This Dataset is available at [Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality) 

## Description

These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are munch more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines. Also, we are not sure if all input variables are relevant. So it could be interesting to test feature selection methods.

There are total 4898 instances available divided in 10 quality types from 0 - 10 (highest).
